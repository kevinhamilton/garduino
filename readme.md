## What is this?
This is a small project I was working on using Arduino to automatically detect when my a plants soil is dry and automatically water it. Theres a soil moisture sensor, water level sensor and a tiny pump involved. 

When the water resevour is low I want some form of alert.

Eventually i'll add a backend API to log these stats because I want some cool graphs about my Cilantro.

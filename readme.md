## What is this?
This is a small project I was working on using Arduino to automatically detect when my plants are dry and automatically water them to an appropriate level. There's also a water resevour that will be monitored and some form of alert when it gets low.


 Eventually i'll add a backend API to log these stats because I want some cool graphs about my Cilantro.

## Future
 I figured I would try this out with a pot of Cilantro and see how it goes, then expand the idea from there.
